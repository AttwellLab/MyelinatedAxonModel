*This is a modified version of the [myelinated axon model](https://github.com/AttwellLab/MyelinatedAxonModel/tree/master/MyelinatedAxonModel) gathering the parameters needed to run the simulations in Lezmy et al. (2021, Science), both for the infinite axon model and for the model describing a pyramidal cell soma attached to a myelinated axon with 3 nodes and a terminal bleb.

*This version of the model and the associated GUI have been tested using MATLAB R2019a running on Windows 10.   

*Full documentation on how to install and run the code is available in the original model deposition.

*This version of the model is licensed under the same MIT license as the orginal model.
